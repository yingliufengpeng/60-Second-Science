    "Well, what did I say? Buck's real fighter, all right." said Francois the next morning
    when he discovered that Spitz had disappeared and that Buck was covered in blood.

    "Spitz fought like a wolf, " said Perrault, as he looked at the bites all over Buck.

    "And Buck fought like ten wolves," answered Francois. "And we'll travel faster now. No
    more Spitz, no more trouble."

    Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks
    was the best dog that he had. Buck Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place.

    "Look at Buck!" said Francois, laughing. "He's kiiled Spitz, and now he wants to be lead 
    -dog. Go away, Buck!"

    He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again. Solleks was unhappy too. He was 
    frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back, Buck took Solleks' place again. 
    Now Francois was angry.

    "I'll show you!" he cried, and went to get a heavy club from the sledge.

    Buck remembered the man in the red coat, and moved away. This time, when Solleks was 
    harnessed as lead-dog, Buck did not try to move in. He kept a few metres away and 
    circled around Francois carefully. But when Francois called him to his old place 
    in front of Dave(站在Dave之前的老位置), Buck refused. He had won his fight with Spitz 
    and he wanted to be lead-dog.

    For an hour the two men tried to harness him. Buck did not run away, but he did not 
    let them catch him. Finally, Francois sat down, and Perrault looked at his watch. It 
    was getting late. The two man looked at one another and similed Francois walked up 
    to Solleks, took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place.
    Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was 
    now the one at the front, but Buck did not move. 

    "Put down the club, " said the Perrault.

    Francois dropped the club, and immediately Buck came up to he front of the team. Francois
    harnessed him, and in a minute the sledge was moving.

    Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quickly and led the other dogs well.
    A new leader made no differece to Dave and Solleks; they continuted to pull hard. But 
    the other dogs had had an easy life(不卖力气) when Spitz was leading. They were surprised 
    when Buck made them wrok hard and punished them for their mistakes Pike, the second dog, 
    was usually lazy; but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever
    pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe, another dog, and after that
    there were no problems with him. The team started to pull together, and to move faster
    and faster.

    "I've never seen a dog like Buck!" cried Francois, "Never! he's worth a thousand dollars.
    What do you think, Perrault?"

    Perrault agreed. They were moving quickly, and covering more gound every day. The snow was 
    good and hard, and no new snow fell. The temperaute dropped to 45 below zero, and didn't
    change.

    This time there was more ice on the Thirty Mile River, and they crossed in a day. Some days
    they ran a hundred kilometres, or even more. They reached Skageway in fourteen days; the 
    fastest time ever.

    For three days the dogs rested in Skageway. Then Francois put his arms around Buck's neck 
    and said goodble to him. And that was last of Francois and Perrault. Like other men, they 
    pass out Buck's life(永远消失) for ever.

    Two new men took Buck and his team back north on the long journey to Dawson, travelling with 
    several other dog-teams. It was heavy work; the sledge was loaded with letters for the gold 
    miners of Dawson. Buck did not like it, but he worked hard, and made the other dogs work 
    hard, too. Each day was the same. They started early, before it was light, and at night they 
    stopped and camped and the dogs ate. For the dogs this was the best part of the day, first
    eating, then resting by the fire.

    Buck liked to lie by the fire, looking at the burning wood. Sometimes he thought about 
    Mr. Miller's hourse in California. More of ten(大多时候) he remembered the man in the red 
    coat and his club, the deatch of Curly, the fight with Spitz, and the good things that 
    had eaten. But sometimes he remembered other things. These were things that he remembered 
    through his parents, and parents' parents, and all the dogs which had lived before him.

    Sometimes as he lay there, he seemed to see, in a walking dream, a different fire. And 
    he saw next to him, not the Indian cook, but another man, a man with shorter legs, and 
    longer arms. This man had long hair and deep eyes, and made strange noises in his throat.
    He was very frightened of the drak, and looked around him all the time, holding a havey 
    stone in his hand. He wore the skin of an animal on his back, and Buck could see thick(浓密的)
    hair all over his body.

    Buck sat by the fire with this hairy man, and in the circling darkness beyond the fire 
    he could see many eyes -- the eyes of hungry animals waiting to attack. And he growled 
    softly in his dream until the Indian cook shouted, "Hey, Buck, wake up!" Then the strange
    would dissppeared and Buck's eyes saw the real fire again.

    When they reached Dawson, the dogs were tired, and needed a week's rest. But in two days
    they were moving south again, with another heavy load of letters. Both dogs and men were 
    unhappy. It snowed every day as well, and on soft new snow it was harder work pulling the 
    sledges.

    The men took good care of their dogs. In the evening, the dogs ate first, the men second, 
    and they always checked the dogs' feet before they slept. But every day the dog became 
    weaker. Buck had pulled sledge for three thousand kilometres that winter, and he ws as
    tired as the others.

    But Dave was not only tired; he was ill. Every evening he lay down the minute after the 
    sledge stopped, and did not stand up until morning. The men looked at him, but they could 
    find no broken bones. Something was wrong inside.

    One day he started to fall down while in his harness. The sledge stopped, and the driver
    took him out his harness. He wanted to give him a rest, and let him run free behind the 
    sledge. But Dave did not want to stop working. He hated to see another dog doing his work, 
    so he ran along beside the sledge, trying to push Solleks out his place. When the sledge 
    made its next stop, Dave bit through Solleks harness and pushed him away. Then he stood 
    there, in his old place in front of the sledge, waiting for his harness and the order to 
    start pulling.

    The diver decided it was kinder to let him work. Dave pulled all day, but next morning 
    he was too weak to move. The diver harnessed up without Dave, and drove a few hundred 
    metres. Then he stopped, took his gun, and walked back. The dogs heard a shot, and then 
    the man came quickly. The sledge started to move again; but Buck knew, and every dog 
    knew, what had happened.
