    The wild animal was strong in Buck, and as he traveld acrocss the snow, it grew stronger
    and stronger. And as Buck grew stronger, he hated Spitz more and more, although he was careful
    never to start a fight.

    But Spitz was always showing his teeth to Buck, trying to start a fight. And Buck knew that 
    if he and Spitz fought, one of them would die.

    The fight almost happened one night when they stopped by Lake Laberge. There was heavy snow
    and it was very cold. The lake was frozen and Francois, Perrault, and the dogs had to spend 
    the night(过夜) on the ice, under a big rock(巨石). Buck had made  a warm hole in the snow and 
    was sorry to leave it to get his piece of fish. But when he had eaten and returned to his hole,
    he found Spit in it. Buck had tried not to fight Spitz before, but this was too much(但是这次
    忍无可忍). He attacked him angrily. Sptiz was surprised. He knew Buck was big, but he didn't know
    he was so wild. Francois was surprised too, and guessed why Buck was angry. "Go on Buck!" he 
    shouted. "Fight him, the dirty thief!"

    Spitz was also ready to fight, and the two dogs circled one another, looking for the change to 
    jump in. But suddenly there was a shout from Perault, and they saw eighty or hundred dogs around
    the sledge. The dogs came from an Indian village, and they were searching for food that they could
    smell on the sledge. Perrault and Francois tired to fight them off with their clubs, but the dogs, 
    made cray by the smell of the foodd, showed their teeth and fought back.

    Buck had never seen dogs like these. They were all skin and bone, but hunger made them fight like 
    wild things. Three of them attacked Buck and in seconds his head and legs were badly bitten. Dave 
    and solleks stood side by side, covered in blood, fighting bravely. Joe and Pike jumped on one dog, 
    adn Pike broek its neck with on bite. Buck caught another dog by the neck and tasted blood. He threw 
    simself on the next one, and then felt theeth in his own neck. It was Spitz, attacking him from the 
    side.

    Perrualt and Francois came to help with clubs, but when they had to back to save the food. It was safer
    for the nine sledge dogs to run away cross the lake. Several of thenm were badly hurt, and they spent 
    an unhappy night hding among the trees.

    At first light(第二天) they returned to the sledeg and found Perrualt and Francois tired and angry. Half their 
    food was gone. The Indian dogs had even eaten one of Perault's shoes. Francois looked at his dogs unhappily.

    "Ah, my friends," he said softly, "Perhaps those bites will make you ill. What do you think, Perault?"

    Perault said nothing. They still had six hundred kilometers to travel, and he hoped very much that his sledeg
    dogs had not caught rabies(狂犬病) from the Indian dogs.

    The harness was torn and damaged and it was two hours before thery were moving, travelling slowly and painfully
    over the most difficult country that they had been in.

    The Thirty Mile River was not frozen. It ran too fast to freeze. They spent six days trying to find a place to 
    cross, and every step was dangerous for dogs and men. Twelve times they found ice bridges across the river, and 
    Perault walked carefully onto them, holding a long piece of wood. And twelve times he fell through a bridge and 
    was saved by the piece of wood, which caught(幸亏有) on the sides of the hole. But the temperature was 45 below 
    zero, and each time Perault fell into the water, he had to light a fire to dry and warm himself. Once, the sledge
    fell through the ice, with Dave and Buck, and they were covered in ice by the time Perault and Francois pulled 
    them out the river. Again, a fire was needed to save them. Another time, Spitz and the dogs in front fell through
    the ice----Buck and Dave and Francois at the sledge had to pull backwards. That day they travelled only four hundred
    metres.

    When they got to the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck and the other dogs were very, very tired. But they were late, so 
    Perault made them run faster. In three days they went a hunderd and eighty kilometres and reached the Five Fingers.

    The other dogs had hard feet from year of pulling sledgs, but Buck's feet still soft from his easy life down south.
    All day he ran painfully, and when they camped for the night, he lay down like a dead dog. He was hungry, but he was 
    too tired to walk to the fish, so Francois brouhgt it to him. One day Francois made four little shoes for him, and this 
    made Buck more comfortable. Francois forget the shoes one morning, and Buck refused to move. He lay on his back with 
    his feet in the air(四脚朝天), until Francois put the shoes on. Later his feet grew harder and the shoes were not needed.

    One moring, at the Pelly River, a dog called Delly went suddenly mad. She howled long and loud like a wolf and then jumped
    at Buck. Buck ran, with Doly one step behid him. She could not catch him, but he could not escape from her. They ran half 
    a kilometere, and then Buck heard Francois call to him. He truned an ran toward the man, sure that Francois would save 
    him. Francois stood, holding his axe, and as Buck passed, the axe crashed down Doll's head.

    Buck fell down by the sledge, too tired to move. Immediatlely, Spitz attcked him and bit his helpless enemy(敌人) twice, 
    as hard as he could. But Francois saw this, and gave Spitz a terrible beating for it.

    "he's wild dog, that Spitz, " said Perault. "One day he'll kill Buck."

    "Buck is wilder, " replied Francois. "I've been watching him. One day he'll get very angry and he'll fight Spitz; and he'll 
    win." Francois was right. Buck wanted to be lead-dog. Spitz kenw this and hated him. Buck started to help the other dogs 
    when Spitz punished them for being lazy. One moring, Pike refused to get up, and Spitz looked for him everywhere. When he 
    found him, he jumped at him. But suddenly, Buck attacked Spitz. The other dogs saw this, ana it became more and more difficult
    for Spitz to lead them. But the days passed without a change fro a fight, and soon they were pulling into Dawson City on a cold 
    grey afternoon.

    They stayed in Dawson for seven days. When they left, Perault was carrying some very import papers, and he wanted to trvel back 
    as fast as possible.

    They travelled eight kilometres the first day, and the same the second. But it was difficult work for Francois. Buck and Spitz hated 
    each other, and the other dogs were not afraid of Spitz any more. One night Pike stole half a fish from Spitz, and ate if standing 
    next to Buck. And ervery time Buck went near Spitz, he growled and the hair on his back stood up angrily. The other dogs fought in 
    their harness and Francois often had to stop the sledge. He knew that Buck was the problem, but Buck was too clever for him and Francois
    never saw him actually starting a fight.

    One night in camp, the dogs saw a snow rabbit in a second they were chasing it, with Spitz in front. Neary was another camp, with fifty
    dogs, who who also joined the chase. The rabbit was runing fast on top of she snow, but the snow was soft, and it was more difficult for 
    the dogs. When Spitz caught the rabbit, throwing it in the air with his teeth, Buck was just behid. Spitz stopped, and Buck hit him, very
    hard. The two dogs fell in the snow. Spitz bit Buck very quickly, twice, and then jumped away, watching carefully.

    The time had come(机会来了), and Buck knew that he or Spitz must die. They wathed one another, circling slowly. The moon was 
    shing brightly on the snow, and in the cold still air not a leaf(叶子) moved on the trees(树叶纹丝不动). The other dogs finished eating the rabbit
    and then truned to wathch.

    Spitz was a good figher. He was full of hate and anger, but he was also intelligent. Every time Buck tried to bite his throat, he met Spitz's 
    own teeth. Then, each time Buck attacked, Sptitz move and bit him on the side as he passed. After a few minutes, Buck was covered in blood.

    He attacked again, but this time turned at the last minute and went under Spitz, biting his left front leg. The bone broke, 
    and Spitz was standing on three legs. Buck tried to knock Spitz down, and then repeated his earlier and broke Spitz's right front
    leg.

    There was no hope for Spitz now. Buck got ready for his final attack, while the cicle of sixty dogs watched, and crowed nearer and 
    nearer, waiting for the end. At last Buck jumped, in and out, and Spitz went down in the snow.
    A second later the waiting pack was on the top of him and Spitz had disappeared. Buck stood and 
    watched. The wild animal had made its kill.
