    Buck did not read the newspapers. He did not know that trouble was coming for every big dog
in Califormia. Men had found gold in the Yukon(育空河), and these men wanted big, strong dogs to
work in the cold and snow of the north.

    Buck lived in Mr Miller's bid house in the sunny Santa Clara valley. There were large gradens and 
fields of friut trees around the house, and a river nearby(一条小河在附近). In a big palce like this,
of course, there were many dogs. There were house dogs and farm dogs, but they were not import. Buck 
was chief dog; he was born here, and this was his palce. He was four years old and weighed sixty kilos.
He went swimming with Mr Miller's sons, and walking with his daughters. He carried the grandchildren 
on his back, and he set Mr Miller's feet in front of the file in winter.

    But this was 1897, and Buck did not konw that men and dogs were hurrying to north-west Canda to 
look for gold. And he did not know that Manuel, one of Mr Miller's gardeners, needed money for his 
large family. One day, when Mr Miller was out, Manuel and Buck left hte garden together. It was just
an evening walk, Buck thought. No one saw them go, and only one man saw them arrive at the railway 
station. This man talked to Manuel, and gabe hime some money. Then he tied a piece of rope around Buck's 
neck.

    Buck growled(咆哮), and was surprised when the rope was pulled hard around neck. He jumped at the man. 
The man caught him and suddenly Buck was on his back(仰面朝上) with his tongue out of his mouth. For a few moments 
he was unable to move, and it was easy for the two men to put him into the train.

    When Buck work up, the train was still moving. The man was sitting and watching him, but Buck was too quick 
for him and he bit the man's hand hard. Then the rope was pulled again and Buck had to let go.

    That evening, the man took Buck to back room of a bar in San Francisco. The barman looked at the man's 
hand and trousers convered in blood.

    "How much are they paying you for this?" he asked

    "I only get fifty dollars."

    "And the man who stole him -- how much did he get?" asked the barman.

    "A hundred. He wouldn't take less"

    "That makes a hundred and fifty. It's a good price for a dog like him. Here, help me to get him into this.(帮我把这条狗弄出去!!!) "

    They took off Buck's rope and pushed him into a wooden box. He spent the night in the box in the back room of the bar.
His neck still ached with pain from the rope, and he could not understand what it all meant. What did they want with hime, 
these strange men? And where was Mr Miller?

    The next day Buck was carried in the box to the railway station and put on a train to the north.

    For two days and nights the train travelled north, and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank. Men on the train laughed
at him and pushed sticks at him through the holes in the box. For two days and nights Buck got angrier and hungrier and thistier. His eys
grew red and he bit anything that moved.

    In Seattle(西雅图) four men took Buck to a small, high-walked back garden, where a fat man in an old red coat was waiting. Buck was not 
now very angry indeed and he jumped and bit at the sides of his box. The fat man simlled and went to get an axe(斧子) and a club(棍子).

    "Are you going to take him out now?" asked one of the men. "Of course." answered the fat man, and he began to break the box with his axe.

    Immediately the four other men climed up onto the wall to wathch from a safe place.

    As the fat man hit the box with his axe, Buck jumped at ths sides, growing(咆哮) and biting, pulling with his teeth at the piece of broken
wood. After a few minutes there was a hole(洞) big enough for Buck to get out.  "Now, come here, red eyes," said the fat man, dropping his axe 
and taking the club in his right hand.

    Buck jumped at the man, sixty kilos of anger, his mouth wide open ready to bite the man's neck. Just before his teeth touched the skin, the 
man hit him with the club. Buck fell to the ground. It was the first time anyone had hit hime with a club and he did not understand. He stood up,
and jumped again. Again the club hit him and he crashed to the ground. Ten times he jumped at the man, and then ten times the club hit his. Slowly 
he got to his feet(站起来), now only just able to stand. There was blood on his nose and mouth and ears. Then the fat man walked up and hit him again, 
very hard, on the nose. The pain was terrible. Again, Buck jumped at the man and again he was hit to the ground. A last time he jumped, and this time,
when the man knocked him down, Buck did not nove.

    "He knows how to teach a dog lesson," said one of the men on the wall. Then the four men jumped down and went back to the station. 

    "His name is Buck, " said the fat man to himself, reading the letter that had come with the box. "Well, Buck, my by, " he said in friendly voice,
"We've argued a little, and I think the best thing to do now is stop. Be a good god and we'll be friends. But if you're a bad dog. I'll have to use my 
club again. Understand?"

    As he spoke, he touched Buck's head, and although Buck was angry inside, he did not move. When the man brought him water and meat, Buck drank and then 
ate meat, piece by piece, from the man's hand.

    Buck was beaten (he knew that) but he was not broken. He had learn that a man with a club was stronger than him. Every day he saw more dogs arrive, and 
each dog was beaten by the fat man. Buck understood that a man with club must be obeyed, alghough he did not have to be a friend.

    Men came to seen the fat man and to look at the dogs. Sometimes they paid money and left with one or more of the dogs. One day a short, drak man came 
and looked at Buck.

    "That's a good dog! " he cried, "How much do you want for him?" 

    "Thress hundred dollars. It's a good price, Perrault, " said the fat man.


    Perrault similed and agreed that it was a good price. He knew dogs, and he knew that Buck was an excellent dog.

    "One in ten thoustand,(千里挑一) " Perrault said to himself.

    Buck saw money put into the fat man's hand, and he was not surprised when he and another dog called Curly were taken away by Perrault. He too them to a 
a ship, and later that day Buck and Curly stood and watched the coast(海岸) get further and further away. They had seen the warm south for the last time.

    Perrault took Buck and Curly down to the bottom of the ship. There they met another man, Francois. Perrault was a French-Candadian, but Francisco was half-Indian,
tall and drak. Buck learnt quickly that Perrault and Francisco were fair men(人不错), calm and honest. And they knew everyghing about dogs.

    There were two other dogs on the ship. One was big dog called Spitz, as white as snow. He was friendly to Buck, always similing. He was smiling when he tried
to steal Buck's food at the first meal. Franois was quick and hit Spitz before Buck had tiem to move(还没有来得及动). Buck decided that this was fair, and begain to like Francois 
a little.

    Dave, the other dog, was not friendly. He wanted to alone all time. He ate and slept and was interested in nothing.

    One day was very like another, but Buck notied that the weather was getting colder. One morning, the ship's engines stopped, 
and there was a feeling of excitment in ship. Francois leashed the dogs and tooked them outside. At the first step Buck's feet 
went into something soft and white. He jumped back in surprise. The soft, white thing was also falling through the air, and it fell
onto him. He tried to smell it, and then caught some on his tongue. It bit like fir, and then disappeared. He tried again and 
the same thing happened. People were watching him and laughing, and Buck felt a shamed, although he did not know why. It was his 
first snow.
