    Buck's first day at Dyea Beach(戴依海岸) was terrible. Every hour there was some new, frighting surprise. There was no peace, no rest--only continual noise and movement. And every miniute there was danger, because these dogs men. They knew only the law of club and tooth.
    

    Buck had never seen dogs fight like these dogs; they were like wolves. In a few minutes he learnt this from watching Curly. She tried to make friends with dog, a big one, although not big as she was. There was no warning. The dog jumped on Curly, his teeth closed together, then he jumped away, and Curly's face was torn from eye to mouth.

    Wolves fight like this, biting and jumping away, but the fight did not fnish then. Thirty or forty more dogs ran up an made a circle around the fight, watching silently. Curly tried to attack the dog who had bitten her; he bit her a second time, and jumped away. When she attacked him again, he knocked her backwards, and she fell on the ground. She never stood up again, because this was what the other dogs were waiting for. They moved in, and in a moment she was under a crowd of dogs.

    It was all very sudden. Buck saw Spitz run out from the crow with his tongue out of his mouth, laughing. Then he saw Francois with axe, and two or three other men with clubs jumpwd in among the dogs. Tow minuts later the last of the dogs was chased aswy. But Curly lay dead in the snow, her body torn almost to piece. Curly's deatch often came back to Buck in his dreams. He understood that once a dog was down on the ground, he was dead. He also remembered Spitz laughing, and from that moment he hated him.

    Then Buck had another surprise. Francois put a harness on him. Buck had seen harness on horses, and now he was made to work like a horse, pulling Francois on a sledge(雪橇) into the forst and returning with wood for the fire. Buck worked with Spitz and Dave. The two other dogs had worked in harness before, and Buck learnt by watching them. He alse learnt to stop and turn when Francois shouted.

    "Those three are very good dogs, " Francois told Perrault. "That Buck pull very well, and he's learning quickly." 

    Perrault had import letters adn offical papers to take to Dawson City, so that afternoon he bought two more dogs, two brother called Billee and Joe. Bill was very friendly, but Joe was the opposite. In the evening Perralut bought one more dog, and old dog with one eye. His name was Solleks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he made no friends; all he wanted was to be alone.

    That night Buck discovered another problem. Where was he going to slepp? Francois and Perranlt were in their ten, but when he went in, they shouted angrily and threw at him. Outside it was very code and windy. He lay down in the snow, but he was too cold to sleep.

    He walked around the tents trying to find the other dogs. But, to his surprise, they had disappeared. He walked around Perrualt's ten, very, very code, wondering what to do(想想什么可以去做). Suddenly, the snow under his feet fell in , and he felt something move. He jumped back, waiting for the attack, but heared only a friendly bark(低吠). There, in a warm hole under the snow, was Bille.

    So that was what you had to do(你不得不去做). Buck chose a place, dug himself a hole in a minute he was warm and asleep. He splet well, although his dreams were bad.

    When he work up , at first he did not know where he was. It had snowed in the night and the snow lay thick(厚) and heavy above him. Suddenly he was afraid-- the fear of a wild animal when it is caught and cannnot escape. Crowling, he threw himself at the snow, and a moement later, he had jumped upward into the daylight. He saw the tents and remembered everything, from the time he had gone for a walk with Manuel to the moment he had dug the hole the night before. "Waht did I say?" shouted Francois to Perrault, when he saw Buck come up out of the snow. "That Buck learns quickly." 

    Perralut smiled slowy.He was carrying important papers, and he needed good dogs. He was very pleased to have Buck.

    They bought three more dogs that morning, and a quarter of an hour later all nine dogs were in harness and on their way up the Dyea Canyon. Buck was not sorry to be morning, and although it was hard work, he almost enjoyed it. He was also surprised to see that Dave and Solleks no longer looked bored and miserable. Puling in harness was their job, and they were happy to do it.

    Dave was sledge dog, the dog nearest to the sledge. In front of him was Buck, then came Solleks. In front of them were the six other dogs, with Spitz as leader at the front. Francois had put Buck between Dave and Solleks because they could teache him work. Buck learnt well, and they were good teachers. When Buck pulled the wrong way, Dave alway hit his leg, bug only lightly. Once they stopped, Buck got tied up in his harness, and it took ten minutes to get started agagin. Both Dave and Solleks gave him a good beating(暴揍) for that mistakes. Buck understood, and was more careful after that.

    Day after day Buck pulled in his harness. They started in the morning before it was light, and they stopped in the evenijng after dark, ate a piece of fish, and went to sleep in their holes under the snow. Buck was always hungry. Francois gave him 750 grams of dried fish a day, and it was never enough. The other dogs were given 500 grams; they were smaller and could stay alive on less food.

    Buck learnt to eat quickly; if he was too slow, the other dogs stole his food. He saw Pike, one of the new dogs, steal some meat from the sledge when Perrault wasn't looking. The next day Buck stole some and got away unseen. Perrault was very angry, but he thought another dog, Dub,had taken it and so punished him instead of Buck.

    Buck was leaning to live in the north. In the south he had never stolen, but there he had never been so hungry. He stole cleverly and secretly, remembering the beatings from the man with the club.

    Buck was learning the law of club and tooth.

    He learnt to eat any food -- anything that he could get his teeth into. He learnt to break the ice on water holes with his feet when he wanted to drink. He was stronger, harder, and could see and smell better than before. In a way, he was remembering back to the days when wild dogs travelled in packs through the forest, killing for meat as they went. It was easy fo him to learn to fight like a wolf, because it was in his blood. In the evenings, when he pointed his nose at moon and howled long and loud, he was remembering the dogs and wolves(翻译为祖先) that had come before him.
