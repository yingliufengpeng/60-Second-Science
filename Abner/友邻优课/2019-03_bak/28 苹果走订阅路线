The tech giant has been slow to embrace subscription services, the business model of the future.

Today that may change.

Apple is expected to announce two new subscription products at an event with the tagline(标语) “Show Time”.

A Netflix-style television-streaming business is rumoured, alongside a subscription service for news where magazines and newspapaers can be 
bundled in one place for a monthly fee.

Competing with Amazon Prime and Netflix will not be cheap.

Apple has already invested some $1bn in partnerships with big Hollywood names, including Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg.

Shows from outside suppliers such as HBO may be included, although Netflix has ruled out bolstering the competition. 

Apple is also racing to develop original programming.

It needs new sources of revenue.

Last quarter revenue from iPhones, which accounts for 60% of its sales, fell by 15% compared with the year before.

No wonder it has decided no longer to go against the stream.
