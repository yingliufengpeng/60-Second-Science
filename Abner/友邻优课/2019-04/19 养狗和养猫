2019/04/19 Dogs owners are much happier than cat owners, survey finds

The well-respected survey that’s been a barometer of American politics, cultures and behavior finally got around to the question that 
has bedeviled many a household.

Dog or cat?

In 2018, the General Social Survey findings made it possible to see how pet ownership overlaps with happiness.

For starters, there is little difference between pet owners and non-owners when it comes to happiness, the survey shows.

But when you break the data down by pet type – cats, dog or both – a stunning divide emerges: Dog owners are about twice as likely as 
cat owners to say they’re very happy, with people owning both falling somewhere in between.

Dog people, in other words, are slightly happier than those without any pets. Those in the cat camp, on the other hand, are significantly 
less happy than the pet-less. And having both appears to cancel each other out happiness-wise.

However, correlation doesn’t equal causation, and there are probably a number of other differences between dog and cat owners that account for 
some of the differences. For instance, dog owners are more likely to be married and own their own homes than cat owners, both factors 
known to affect happiness and life satisfaction.
