SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY Kirstjen Nielson will be leaving hear position, and I would like to thank her for her service,” tweented President Donald Trump on the evening of April 7th.

Ms Nielsen was the face of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. 

That policy resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents, and identifying all such families could take up to two years.

But Mr Trump appears to have regarded Ms Nielsen as too feeble for the job.

What she could have done to satisfy Mr Trump is unclear.

He seems to want people to simply stop coming to America that will not happen as long as Central American countries remain week and violent.

Mr Trump prefers noisy fights to the grinding, unglamorous compromise that democratic governance requires.

With a presidential election less than two years away, he would, it seems, prefer a secretary of homeland security who echoes his aggressive
tone and champions his views, however legally unfeasible, to one who patiently explains why he cannot do as he pleases.
