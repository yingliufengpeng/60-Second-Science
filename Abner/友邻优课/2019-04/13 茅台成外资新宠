201904/13 Global Investors Line Up for a Shot of Kerosene-Smelling Chinese Liquor

A Chinese liquor stock has captured the imagination of global investors as a proxy for affluent consumers in the world’s second-largest
economy.

Kweichow Moutai Co. has outperformed technology giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. And Tencent Holdings Ltd. – two favorite picks for 
foreigners looking to play China – in recent years and is beating the in 2019. American mutual-fund managers and other large investors 
have piled in.

Kweichow Moutai has benefited from moves to open up Chinese markets to global capital, and foreign investors’ thirst for ways to bet 
on a rising middle class.

Foreign holdings through a Hong Kong trading link totaled 9.5% of Kweichow Moutai’s shares as of the end of last week, or $15.4 billion—the 
highest sum for any stock listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen.

While Alibaba and Tencent offer investors a chance to bet on rapid online growth, Kweichow Moutai is a much more traditional consumer-focused 
proposition.

The company specializes in baiju, a powerful clear spirit distilled from sorghum that is often used for toasts at state banquets and 
business dinners in China. The liquor has a pungent smeall that some have likened to kerosene.
