2019/4/14 South Korea Rles Anti-Abortion Law Unconstitutional

South Korea’s Constitutional Court on Thursday ruled as unconstitutional a 66 year-old law that made abortion a crime punishable by up to 
two years in prison, calling for an amendment to the law.

The court gave parliament until the end of 2020 to revise the law. If lawmakers do not meet that deadlines, the law will become null 
and void. It currently remains in force.

The verdict represented a landmark, if tentative, victory for abortion rights advocates, who have campaigned for the law’s abolition 
as a major step in bolstering woment’s rights. In a government-financed survey of 10,000 women aged 15 to 44 last year, three-quarters 
called for liberalizing abortion regulations.

In South Korea, abortion is widespread despite the ban, which allows exceptions such as in cases of rape or when a woman’s health is 
at risk.

But the ban on abortion has rarely been enforced in 2017 alone, 49,700 abortions took place, nearly 94 percent of them illegally, 
according to estimates released by the government-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs.

Until recently, abortion carried little of the emotional or religious significance in South Korea that it does in many Western 
countries.
