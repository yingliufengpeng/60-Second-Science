Robert Mueller delivered his report into links between President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russian government to the Justice Department
on Friday.

On Sunday William Barr, the attorney-general released a four-page summary explaining that Mr Mueller’s investigation “did not establish(证明)
that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government”.

That is unquestionably good news for the president.

Mr Barr also concluded that Mr Trump did not obstruct justice, despite Mr Mueller’s more ambiguous conclusion that the president neither committed
nor could be exonerated from that crime.

The White House claimed “complete exoneration”, but the political battle is only beginning.

Democrats will press for the full report to be made public, as Mr Trump and 420 members of Congress have urged.

And Jerry Nadler, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, vowed(发誓) to call(传唤) Mr Barr to testify(作证), “in light of(考虑到) the very concerning
discrepancies and final decision making(最总裁定) at the Justice Department”
