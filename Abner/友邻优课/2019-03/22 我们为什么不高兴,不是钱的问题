The relationship between cash and contentment has consumed philosophers for millennia. “Happiness economics” is now a lively field of studay. 

Today the United Nations release the “World Happiness Report” to mark its “International Day of Happiness”.

The event may seem risible(可笑的), but the report is penned(执笔) by academics and use hard data from Gallup, a pollster, to rank 156 counties
according to their average self-reported life satisfaction.

Nordic countires tend to be happiest; African ones the most miserable(悲惨的).

At first glance the relationship between GDP per person and self-reported happiness seems irrefutable(无可辩驳的).

But over time countries that get richer do not necessarily become more joyful.

This paradox, first observed by Richard Easterlin in 1974, has been hotly contested for years.

Take India and China. While GDP per person in both countries has broadly doubled over the past decade, their cheeriness(开心) has gone in opposite
directions.

Working out(解决) precisely why that is could keep wonks happy for years.
