China’s new social media craze: Paying random people to shower you with over-the top compliments

Sick of all the hatred being spread online, Chinese internet users are flocking to groups on social media where they can pay to be given exaggerated compliments.

Users can search for the groups – known as “kuakuaqun,” Mandarin for praising groups” – on Taobo, an e-commerce site run by China’s Alibaba. Once you purchase a round of compliments, the seller will contact you with an invitation to a group on Wechat. There, you will be showered with praise from various people.

A WeChat group administrator known as “Abelard” said people need to learn to give the accept praise more often. “We don’t praise ourselves and we become stingy while giving praise to others” he said in a message.

Social media has been criticized for having a negative impact on mental health and companies have been accused of not doing enough to police potentially offensive or extreme content on their platforms.

The pay for praise trend could also be a response to so-called “curse groups” which popped up on WeChat last year. Users would enter those groups and hurl insults at each other.
