Lev Strauss & Company, the company that traces its roots to the days of the California Gold Rush, started trading publicly on Thursday for the 
second time in its 165-year history.

Traders in New York were clad in(身穿) denim pants(牛仔裤) and jean jackets, as the stock exchanges suspended its prohibition on wearing jeans 
for the day.

Levi’s has been undergoing a turnaround(改观) for the better part of the past decade under Charles V. Bergh, the company’s chief executive, who 
joined the company in 2011. The executive has overseen(监督/管理/负责) an increase in sales to $5.6 billion last year, with net profit of $285 
million.

The company first listed its shares(首次上市) in the 1970s, but was taken private in 1985 through a leveraged buyout led by descendants of 
Strauss, known as the Haas family. They wanted to take a longer-term view of the business rather than focus on short-term results and 
fluctuations(波动).

Mr. Bergh said that Levi’s chose to return to public markets because of the renewed strength of the brand and its growth potential in categories 
like women’s apparel(服装) and international markets like China.
