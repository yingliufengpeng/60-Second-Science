    Mixed-ability swimmers: fertility(生育能力)

    Fertility treatments(生育治疗) by-and-large(总体上的) focus on women, who are injected with hormones(荷尔蒙) and told what to eat while consulatnts pore over(仔细阅读) 
    the quantity and quality of their egg supply.

    A study this weeek suggests that, perhaps, the quality of sperm(精子) also has long-lasting(持久的) consequences.

    Sione Immler at the University of East Anglia studies what makes some sperm more likely to fertilise eggs.

    She began with zebrafish. In the wild, males ejaculate(射精) into water, where some sperm stop swimming after 25 seconds while others last longer.

    In the lab, Dr Immler mixed eggs with either shorter-lived or longer-lived sperm.

    Her team were surprised to find that offspring produced by the longer-lived varitey themselves produced more and healthier offspring.

    She posits(假设) that even within a single ejaculate not all sperm are made equal, and those differences can afffect future generations.

    That could have wider implications for assisted reproduction of other animals -- perhaps even that of Homo sapiens(人类,智人).
