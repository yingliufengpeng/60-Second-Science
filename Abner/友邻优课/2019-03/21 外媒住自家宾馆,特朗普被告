    Presidential profits: Trump in court

    The president’s business interests come under scrutiny today at an appeals court in Virginia
    District of Columbia and Maryland v Trump is the furthest along of three lawsuits accusing the president of violating the constitution’s
    emoluments clauses, a set of obscure anti-corruption provisions that have never been fully interpreted by a court.

    These bar gifts from foreign governments and prevent officials from goosing their salaries with payments from states or the federal 
    government.

    In a July ruling(裁决), a federal judge wrote that foreign governments had booked rooms at the Trump International Hotel – a lavish Washington 
    property – “precisely because of the president’s association with it”.

    The judge gave the District of Columbia and Maryland standing to sue and allowed the collection of evidence to proceed.

    Department of Justice lawyers representing the president say that demanding records from Trump businesses violates the separation of 
    powers and threats to distract him from the “performance of his constitutional duties”.
