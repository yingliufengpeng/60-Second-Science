Brits Voting Online to Cancel Brexit.
More than 3 million people have signed a petition to cancel Brexit on the U.K. government’s official petitions website – so many that the websites crashed multiple lines.

Votes were being cast at a rate of 1500 every 60 seconds before the sit crashed at about 9 a.m. U.K. time on Thursday. By mid-afternoon, the site was back online but suffering intermittent outages.

There were 2 million signatures by Thursday evening and 3.8 million by Friday evening.

The U.K. government must now allow a debate on the petition’s contents in parliament.

But the number of signatures still pales in comparison to the mumber of votes cast in the U.K.’s 2016 referendum on leaving the E.U., where votes decided to leave by a marin of 17.4 million (51.9%) to 16.1 million (48.1%).

There is also no guarantee the debate will happen before the U.K. leaves the E.U.

The U.K. could legally unilaterally cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, the European Court of Justice ruled last December.

For Theresa May, following the petition’s advice to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 is unconscionable.

But many Brits believe revoking Article 50 is the only remaining option to avert what even May’s own office now admits is a “crisis”.
