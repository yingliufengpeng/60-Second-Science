    I spoke to a friend and a coach at the time when I was in the amateurs and he said 
    to me, "Richar.. do something else on the side, like you can go to school... but 
    becuase just.. just don't put your eggs all in one basket." And me being young, 
    I kind that in a way like you don't believe in my ability that I can be successful 
    in boxing(拳击), I'm putting everything into this.

    But it's only now I understand what he said and I still made that decision anyway
    to go uni(大学). It fells really good to be a cahmpion(冠军).

    You know, just to have something to show for all the hard work and dedication(投入)
    you've been putting in. I developed a deep passion in inspiring others because when 
    I was younger we did not have role models(榜样), positive role models to look up 
    to. So I put my life out there, I didn't have to tell my story to the world.

    But I tought its going to help one person, then let me do it. Considering all of 
    the kinfe crime and all of the tonnes of(很多) things that's going on in our country at 
    the momnent. it's so important that people like me can come out and do this. And 
    I'm happy. I cound've been in jail for sitting down for life, I could've been dead.\

    Like this is ... this ia amazing that I'm even able to do this and it gives me 
    the most happiness. I want to visit thousands of institutions, give my story, 
    talk to different people... see if I can affect all these communities suffering 
    form diferent types of issuses. In terms of boxing, I believe that just need to 
    get the domestic titles(国内冠军) and get that experience, and then perform on a 
    big stage, and one day... and it will come, I will be the world champion.
