    We try and have a date night once a week. And we'll sit down, we'll put some music 
    on.

    We can have English music, Turkish music. There's a bit of dancing. Even at bedtime 
    we'll Skype and we'll go to sleep with the phones next to the pillow on Skype.

    The initmacy is really dificult. Sometimes I just want a cuddle(怀抱).

    There's nothing in the world to explain this. Being apart is so, so hard.

    I really can't wait to call. I can't wait to see Danielle's face, and all the kids,
    and hear their voice. Well go on, tell me what you did at school today?

    I did maths. I've lost a lot of family members and a lot of friends through choosing to 
    got down the route of being with Gorkem.

    People wil say to me, you kow: " I don't know why you're getting upset you've chosen 
    to be with a foreigner." I can't help who fallen in love with(会爱上谁)

    Papa's made it. Did Para make the paratha(抛饼) in Bangalore?

    We had our daughter two years ago. And we've been very happily living in India 
    with us both working in India.

    We'd always thought about moving back to the UK at some point. The impetus(动力)
    came now because my maternal(母亲般的) grandmother who I'm very close to and had 
    a really important role in my upbringging stopped being able to fly for medical 
    reasons.

    Essentially, what's happened is that my daughter has been deprived of both of her 
    paretns. My work is over two hours from my home.
