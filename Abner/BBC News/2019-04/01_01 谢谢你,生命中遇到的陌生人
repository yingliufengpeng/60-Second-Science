    So, we're going to Bedford today, and to meet the driver who helped me the night that I tried to end my life. To be albe to say thank you to 
    him and that it did make a difference.

    And hopefully for him to see or for him to know that he did help, because I don't know how he feels about it eigher. It's goint to be nice 
    to meet her, it would be nice to see what's happpened since that point from her point of view.

    I now from my point of view obviously, I think about it quite regularly, especially when I'm in the area, you konw, the place where we did 
    meet. So I'm kind of here today to meet her, and see how her life's changed and, what positive things she's done with it.

    Liv? You Ok? Yeah, I'm alright thank you. How are you? How've you been? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty good at the moment.

    Good. Have a seat. So what have you been up to since we're...? Since we met, since we met, yeah.

    Things are pretty all right in the last few months. I'm doing a lot with the police at the moment.

    I've been doing some training with them on how to help in a mental health crisis. Ah that's excellent. That's an element that I'm not used to, 
    you know, and I have to be really subjective.

    I had to listen, you know, we had to talk, and I wanted to, I wanted to... It worked really well, because I thik once you've knid of got someone 
    to just stop and engage, thenyou're kind of there really. Yeah.

    I was like, "you're goint to be angry, wveryone's going to hate me." "Everyone's going to be like, judging me." When we met you're in that 
    situation I can imagine what's what you'd think, but there's so many more people out there.

    When we were talking about your family, you know, there's people out there.
