    Anger of like being in traffic jams every time, over and over aagin. I think it's good to smash 
    other cars  thinking about that.

    I love working with cars. Never really tore one apart like this. This gives a good opportunity to 
    see what it's like to actually break one.

    I'm basically working a consulting firm and we deal with the frustrations of people every day. Good 
    way of getting rid of our anger.

    And do you nomally express your anger in a kind of violent, destructive way? No. Not really. Usually 
    I'm pretty cool and collected(镇静的).

    But, actually to be completely honest it kinds of scares me. You konw, now it's cars next time it can 
    be sometings else(这次是砸车下次就不知道是什么了).

    I do believe CarSmash is a great way to have some anger released you konw? Instead of doing it on the 
    street or in a way where it's illeagal.

    You know, you can do it in our scrapyard(废品堆放场) in a legal way. It's different if a group of friends 
    or work group for example does that just one time.

    But it's still kind of tricky(不可靠的方法) because they might like it and then they might wwant to go and express their 
    anger in this way. And then you're actually giving yourself the messag that this is OK instead of learning other 
    productive ways.

    For example, to calm yourself down, to regulate your emotions, te be mindful of what's happening, to take a break 
    than actually breaking things. It's(砸碎汽车) harder than expected but it's more satisfying than I expected.(但是比我想象的要好)
