    It was very difficut for me and it was a great shock for me also, when they were born 
    because we didn't any indication that they were twins and conjoined twins.

    So a very difficult sitation for children suffering from severe disablity in Senegal. 
    So I didn't want to let them face any kind risk for their survial.

    What I've decided at this point is not to focus on what will happen tomorrow. I'm just 
    trying to look after them and to make them happy as possible.

    Like any other siblings, it can go from chatting, lauging together, claping, playing 
    together and sometimes arguing and sometimes disputing toys. They're here, they're 
    warriors.

    And what I can do is just be beside them. Killing one of my child for another is something 
    I can't do.

    I can't allow myself to choose who will live, who will die. No, no.
