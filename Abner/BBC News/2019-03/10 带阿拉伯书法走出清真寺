    For me when I look at Arabic calligraphy(阿拉伯书法) it's very elegant. In a way it's also quite fragile, very delicate.

    Hi I'm Nur Yasmin Irfan Nurdin. I'm 20 years old and I'm a calligraphy student. At first it's a bit hard but once you get used to it, once, 
    you know, practise it a bit more it kind of just becomes more naurally.

    I was always surrounded with it especially iin my house where I have it hnging up on my walls. did you ever think you'd end up doing it?

    No actually I didn't think so because I already dif it for a few years, back when I was in my religious school. In Arabic it's called knutt 
    and when you write Arabic you called knutt al-arabiyya.

    This is the bamboo pen, in Arabic calligraphy it's very important to do the letters and the proportions. I've found there are only three 
    of four people avaiable in the world who can provide these kind of custom-made pens.

    It keeps you close to your religion. It's not specific to the Asian background. So it's uniting force(凝聚力)? It unites people? It is.

    In the future I can definitely see myself using it in my graphic design projects and also when I want to use it in like poster design. It has
    a future outside the Mosque(清真寺) then? Yeah, definitely, I think so.
