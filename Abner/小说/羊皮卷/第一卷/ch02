    The career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and sespair 
    and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one a top antoher, would cast a shadow 
    down upon all pyramids of the earth.

    Yet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hads I now hold the charts(航海图) which will guide 
    me through perilous(汹涌的) waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but but a dream.

    Failure no longer will be my payment for struggle.

    Just as nature made no provision(货物) for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any 
    provision for my life to suffer failure.

    Failure, like pain, is alien to(水火不容) my life.

    In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain.

    Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisfom and priciples wich will guide me out of the shadows
    into the sunlight of wealth, position, adn happiness far beyond my most extravagant(夸张的) dreams 
    until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward.
