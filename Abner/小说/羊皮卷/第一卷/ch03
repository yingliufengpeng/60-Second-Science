    Time teaches all things to he who lives forever but I have not the luxury of eternity.

    Yet within my allotted(分配的) time I must practice the art of patience for nature acts never in haste.

    To create the olive, king of all trees, a hundred years is required.

    Anonion plant is old in nine weeks. I have lived as an pnion plant.

    It has not pleased me. Now I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greastest of salesman.

    And how will this be accomplished?

    For I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into 
    pools of self-pity.

    The answer is simple.

    I will commence(开始) my journey unencumbered(没有阻碍的) with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap(障碍) of meaningless 
    experience.
