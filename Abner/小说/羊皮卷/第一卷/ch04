    Nature alread has suupplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated(高估),
    usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly.

    In truth, experience teaches thorughly yet her course of instruction devours(吞没) men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with 
    the time necessary to acquire her special wisdom.

    The end finds it wasted on dead men.

    Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion, an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow.

    Only principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these scrolls(羊皮卷).
