    Today I begin a new life.

    Today I shed(脱落) my old skin which hath(has), too long, suffered the bruises(伤痕) 
    of failures and the wounds of mediocrity(庸人).

    Today I am born anew and my birthpalce is a vineyard(葡萄园) where there is fruit 
    for all.

    Today I will pluck(采摘) grapes(葡萄) of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines(葡萄树) in 
    the the vineyard, for there were planted by the wisest(聪明的人) of my profession(同行) 
    who have come before me, generation upon generation.

    Today I will savor(品尝) the taste of grapes from these vines(藤本植物) and verily(真实地)
    I will swallow the seed of success buried in each and new life will sprout(发芽)
    with me.
