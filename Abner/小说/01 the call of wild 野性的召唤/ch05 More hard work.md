    Thirty days after leaving Dawson City, the team arrived back in Skagway. They were very 
    tired. Buck now weighed only fifty kilogrmas, and the other dogs were also very thin(瘦).

    They were not ill; they just needed a long, long rest. But as Skagway there were mountains
    of letters waiting to go north, so the men had to buy new, strong dogs. The old ones, now 
    useless for work, were sold.

    Two American men, called Hal and Charles, bought Buck and his team, together with the 
    harness. Charles was forty years old, with light hair and water bule eyes. Hal was a 
    young man of twenty with a big shiny(发亮的/磨损的) gun and a big knife in his belt. These
    things, more than anything, showed how young he was. Both men were clearly new to the 
    north, and its hard and dangerous life.

    They took the dogs back to their untidy(混乱的) cmap, where a woman was waiting. This was 
    Mercedes -- Charle's life and Hal's sister.

    Buck watched the men take down the ten and load all their luggage on the sledge. They 
    didn't know how to do it sensibly(明智地), and every time they put something on the sledge,
    Mercedes moved it. Often they had to take thing off the sledge and start again.

    Three men camp up and watched, laughing

    "You've got a heavy load on that sldeg, " said one of them "Why dont't you leave the tent
    here in Skagway?"

    "How could we live without a tent?" asked Mercedes, throwing up her hand in the air.

    "It's spring now. You won't have any more cold weather."

    "I must have a tent, " she answered, and helped Charles and Hal with the last few boxes.

    "Do you think that load will stay on?" asked another man.

    "Why shouldn't it?" asked Charles.

    "Well, it's a bit heavy on top. Do you think your dogs will be able to pull that?" 

    "Of course they wil, " said Hal. The sledge was now ready to go. "Come on, dogs, pull!"
    he shouted.

    The dogs pulled as hard as they could, but the sledge did not move.

    "The lazy animal! " shouted Hal, picking up his whip.

    But Mercedes stopped him "Oh, Hal, you mustn't, " she cried, pulling the whip away from 
    him. "The poor dogs. you must promise to be nice to them(一定好善待他们) or I'm staying here!" 

    "You know nothing about dogs, " answered Hal. "Leave me alone Dogs, Dogs are lazy, and you 
    have to whip them. Everybody knows that. Ask those men if you don't believe me."

    Mercedes turned adn looked at the watching men.

    "They' re tired, if you really want to know, " said one of them "They've been working 
    very hard and they need a rest. "

    "Rest? " laughed Hal. "These stupid dog are just lazy." 

    Now Mercedes decided that her brother was right. "Don't listen to that man, " she said 
    "You're driving our dogs and you do what you think is best."

    Now Hal used his whip on the dogs. They pulled and pulled, but the sledge stayed where 
    it was. Hal was still using his whip when Mercedes stopped him again and put her arms 
    around Buck.

    "You poor, poor dears, " she said. "Why don't you pull hard? -- then nobody will whip 
    you."

    One of the men watching now spoke again. "I don't care what happens to you, " he said,
    "but I'm sorry for the dogs. The sledge is fronzen to the snow, and you'll have to break 
    it out. Push it from one side to the other to break the ice."

    Hal tried again, but this time he broke the ice under the sledge. The heavy sledge started
    to move slowly, Buck and his team pulling hard under the whip. After a hundred metres they 
    had to turn into another street. It was a difficult turn with a top-heavy load, and Hal 
    was not a good driver. As they turned, the sledge went over onto its side, throwing boxes
    and packets into the street. The dog didn't stop. The sledge was not so heavy now and 
    they pulled it easily on its side. The whip had made them angry and they started to run. 
    Hal cried "Stop!" but the dogs countinued through Skagway, and the rest of the luggage 
    fell off as they ran.

    People helped to catch the dogs and to pick up all the things from the street. They also 
    told the men that if they wanted to reach Dawson, they needed twice as many dogs and half 
    as much as luggage. Hal and Charles went back to the camp and started to look at the 
    luggage and throw thing away. Ten, blankets and plates were taken out. Mercedes cried 
    when most her clothes went. When they had finished, Mercedes was still crying, there was 
    a lot of luggage on the road, and there was still a lot to go on the sledge.

    Then Charles and Hal went out and bought six more dogs, so they now had fourteen. But the 
    new dogs were not real sledge--dogs and they knew nothing about the work. Charles and Hal 
    put them into harness, but Buck could not teach them to pull a sldge. So now there were 
    six dogs who couldn't pull at all, and eight who were tired after pulling for four thousands
    kilometres. But Charles and Hal were happy. They had more dogs than any sledge that they 
    had seen at Skagway. They didn't know that no sledge could carry enough food for fourteen 
    dogs.

    The next morning Buck led the team up the street. They moved slowly, because they were 
    tired before they started. Buck had pulled to Dawson and back twice, and he didn't want 
    to do it again. He had watchde Hal and Charles and Mercedes and he saw that they didn't 
    know how to do any thing. And, as the days passed, he saw that they could not learn. It 
    took them half the evening to get everything ready for the night; and it took them half 
    the morning to get ready to leave. And when they did start, they often had to stop because 
    something had fallen off the sledge. On some days they travelled twenty kilometres and 
    on some days only ten.

    They didn't have enogh dog food when they started, and they used what they had much too 
    quickly. Hal gave the dogs extra food because he wanted them to pull harder. Mercedes 
    gave them extra food becuase she was sorry for them. But it was nof food that they wanted, 
    but rest(休息).

    Soon Hal saw that they had travelled only a quarter of the way to Dawson, but had eaten 
    half their food. He had to give the dogs less food. It was easy to give them less food, 
    but it was impossible to make them travel faster.

    Dub had pulled hard and well all the way from Skagway, but he had hurt his leg. It got 
    worse and worse until finally Hal had to shoot him. The six new dogs, now weak and ill 
    from hunger and hard work, died next.

    Hal, Charles, and Mercedes had started the journey happily; but now they were tired, 
    cross(暴躁) and miserable(沮丧). Charles and Hal argued about everything, because each 
    thought that he was working harder than the other. And Mercedes was unhappy because 
    she thought she shouln't have to work. She was tired, so she rode on the sledge, making 
    the work even harder for the dogs. She rode for days, until the dogs could not move the 
    sledge. The men asked her to walk, but she would not leave the sldge. One day they lifted
    her off. She sat in the snow and didn't move. They went off with the slege and travelled 
    five kilometres. Then they turned, went back and lifted her on again.

    Buck and the other dogs were now just skin and bone. They pulled when they could, and 
    when they couldn't they lay down in the snow. When they were whipped, they stood up and 
    tired to pull again.

    One day Bilee fell and could not stand up. Hal killed him and threw him into the snow. 
    Buck and the other dogs knew that soon they were going to die, too. On the next day Koona
    died, and there were only five dogs left; Joe, Pike, Solleks the one-eyed, Teek, and Buck.

    It was beautiful spring weather. The snow and ice were melting, the plants were growing, 
    and the forest animals were waking from their sleep. It was a lovey morning when the two
    men and the five dogs pulling Mercedes on the sledge, came into John Thornton's camp at 
    White Rive. They stopped, and the dogs dropped down immediately to rest.

    John Thornton was mending an axe(做斧子), and he went on working as he talked to Hal.

    "Is it safe to cross the river here? " asked Hal.

    "No, the ice is too thin. It's much too dangerous, answered Thornton.

    "People have told us before, " laughed Hal, "But we got here with no problems."

    "Only somebody very stupid would cross the White River here, " said Thornton.

    "That's what you think, " said Hal. "But we've got to(不得不) get to Dawson. " He picked up his 
    whip. "Come on, Buck! Get up now! Let's go!" 

    Thornton went on woking. He had warned them, but ke knew he couldn't stop these stupid 
    men from going on.

    But Buck didn't get up. Solleks stood up slowly, then Teek and Joe, and finally Pike. 
    But Buck stayed where he was. The whip came down on him again and again. Thornton started 
    to speak, then stopped(想说又忍住了), and begain to walk up and down.

    Hal now put down his whip and started to hit Buck with a club. But Buck had decided not 
    to get up. He had felt thin ice under his feet all ady and he saw thin ice in front him.
    The club hit him again and agian, but Buck felt almost nothing.

    Then suddenly, with a wild cry, John Thornton jumped on Hal, throwing him backwards. 
    Mercedes scremed.

    "If you hit that dog again, I'll kill you, " Thornton shouted.

    "He's my dog, " Hal replied. There was blood on his face. "Get out of my way, or I'll
    hit you, too. I'm going to Dawson."

    Thornton stood between Hal and Buck and did not move. Hal took out his knife, but Thornton
    knocked it out of his hand. Mercedes screamed again. Then Thornton picked up Hal's knife 
    and cut Buck out of the harness.
 
    Hal didn't want to fight, and Buck was not worth fighting for; he was nearly dead. Hal 
    started the sledge and went down towards the river. Buck lifed his and watched the sledge 
    move away. Pike was leading, adn Joe, Teek and Solleks were behind him. Hal was walking 
    in front of the sledge and Mercedes was riding on it; Charles was walking behind.

    As Buck watched, Thornton felt his body with gentle hands, seraching for broken bones.
    Buck was very thin, very tired and very weak, but Thornton didn't think he was going to
    die. Then both dog and man watched the sledge as it went slowly out on to the ice in the 
    middle of the river. Suddenly the back of the sledge went down and the front went up into 
    air. Mercedes screamed, and Charles turned and took one step back(退了一步). Then a big piece of 
    ice broke off, and dogs, sledge and people disappeared; there was only a big hole in the 
    ice.

    John Thornton and Buck looked at one another.

    "You poor thing(坏家伙), " said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.
