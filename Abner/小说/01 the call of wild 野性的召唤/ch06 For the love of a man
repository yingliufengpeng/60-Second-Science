    John Thornton had been ill in Decemer, and his two friends had had to leave 
    him at White River and go on to Dawson. They left him in the camp with plenty 
    of food, and with this two dogs, Skeet and Blackie. Now the spring had come,
    and he was almost well. He lay in the sun by the river with Buck, watching 
    the water and listening to the birds, slowly getting stronger and stronger.

    A rest is very welcome after running five thousand kilomtres, and Buck got 
    fatter and stronger. It was a peaceful, lazy time for man and dogs while 
    they waited fro Thornton's friends to return from Dawson.
