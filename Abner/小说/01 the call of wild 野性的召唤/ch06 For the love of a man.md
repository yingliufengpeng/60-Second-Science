    John Thornton had been ill in Decemer, and his two friends had had to leave 
    him at White River and go on to Dawson. They left him in the camp with plenty 
    of food, and with this two dogs, Skeet and Blackie. Now the spring had come,
    and he was almost well. He lay in the sun by the river with Buck, watching 
    the water and listening to the birds, slowly getting stronger and stronger.

    A rest is very welcome after running five thousand kilomtres, and Buck got 
    fatter and stronger. It was a peaceful, lazy time for man and dogs while 
    they waited fro Thornton's friends to return from Dawson.

    The days passd very happily, and for the first time, Buck learned to love,
    He had never loved a man before. He and Mr Miller in the Stanta valley had 
    been good friends, but Buck had not loved him. John Thornton had saved his 
    life, but he was also a man who was nuturally kind ot aninmals. He took very 
    good care of his dogs, not because it was sensible to do that(出于什么意识), 
    but because he felt they were his children. He was  always talking to Buck, 
    holding his head and shaking it lovingly. In anwser, Buck liked to take Thornton's
    hand gently in his mouth.

    Buck was happy to ie on the ground all day ant watch Thornton. And when Thornton
    spoke to him or touched him, Buck went wild with hpppiness. At first, he was 
    afriad that Thornton was going to disappearl, like Perrault and Francois, and 
    at night he sometimes woke up and went to the ten to make sure that he was 
    still here.

    But something was changing in Buck. He had lived in the north a long time now, 
    and he was almost a wild dog. He was happy to site by Thornton's fire, but he 
    was sat as a wild animal, and his dreams were filled with other animals-dogs, 
    half wolves, and wild wolves. They seemed to call him into the forest, and 
    sometimes Buck wanted to leave the fire and answer the call. But every time 
    he went into the trees, his love for Thornton brought him back.

    It was only Thornton who stopped him going to the forest. Ohter men did not 
    interet him. Vistors to camp tried to make friends with him, but Buck stayed 
    cold. When Thornton's two friends, Han and Pete, arrived from Dawson, Buck 
    refused to notice them at first. Then he saw that they were friends of Thornton's 
    and after he accepted them; but they were not his frienss. They were, like 
    Thornton, kind men, and they understood that Buck loved Thornton, and him alone.

    Thornton, too, understood Buck. One day, Buck and the three men were siting 
    on some high rocks, a hunred metres above the river. Thornton wondered if Buck 
    would obey any oder, even a crazy one. "Jump, Buck" he shouted, pointing down 
    to the river. A second later the three men were holding Buck back as he tried 
    to jump.

    "That was very strange, " said Pete, when they had sat down again.

    "Not strange; wonderful, " said Thornton. "Terrible, too. Sometimes it
    frightens(害怕) me." 

    "Yes. I feel sorry for any man who hits you when Buck's near" said Pete.
    
    "So do I, " said Hans.

    It happened in the autumn in Circle City. A man called Buron was starting 
    a fight with another man in a bar. Thornton stepped between themt to try to 
    stop them. Buck was, as usual, lying in the corner wathing. Burton hit Thornton
    and he nearly fell, just catching a table. Bulk flew through the air at Butor's 
    throat. Burton saved his life by putting up his arm, and was thrown on the 
    groud, with Buck on top of him. Buck took his teeth out of the man's arm and 
    this time bit into his throat. Then a crowd of people pulled Buck off, and a 
    doctor was called. Everyone argged that Buck had only attacked because he saw 
    Thornton in danger, and from that day Buck's name became famous all over the 
    north.

    Later that year, Buck saved Thornton in different way. The three men were taking
    a boat down a fast and rocky river. Thornton was in the boat, while Hans and Pete 
    moved along the river bank, holding the boat with rope. Buck follwed them, keeping 
    a worried eye on Thornton.

    They came to a more dangerous parf of the river, and the boat started to go too 
    quickly. Hand pulled on the rope to stop it, and pulled too hard. The boat 
    turned over(翻船), and Thornton was thrown into the water and carried down 
    river towards rocks where no swimmer could live.

    Buck jumped in immediately and swam three hundred metres until he reached 
    Thornton. Then he turned, and with Thornton holding his tail, Buck swam 
    towards the river bank. But they moved slowly, and all the time the river 
    was carrying them towards the place where the water crashed twenty metres 
    down rocks. Thornton knew that they would not get to the blank quickly engough,
    so let go of Buck, held on to a rock in the middle of the water and shouted, 
    "Go, Buck, go!" 

    Buck swam as hard as he could to the bank, and Pete and Hans pulled him out.

    It was hard for Thornton to hold on to his rock in that wild water, and his firends 
    knew that they had only a few minutes to save him. They tried their rope around 
    Buck, who at once jumped into the river and tried to swim to Thornton. The 
    first time, the water took him past the rock(绕过), and Pete and Hans had to 
    pull him back. The second time, he swam higher up the river, and the water 
    brought him down to Thornton. Thornton held on to Buck, and Hans and Pete 
    pulled the rope as hard as they could. Man and dog disappeared under the water, 
    banging(碰撞) into rocks, turning over and over, sometimes with Buck on top, 
    sometimes Thornton. When Hans and Pete finally pulled them out, both seemed 
    more and more dead than alive But after a while eyes opened and life returned.

    That winte, at Dawson, Buck did something that made him even more famous in 
    the north. It was also very helpful to the three men. They wanted to make a 
    journey to look for gold in the east, and they needed money. They were in a 
    a bar on day when some of the men started to talked about dogs. One man said 
    that he had a dog who was strong engough to pull a sedge with two hundred 
    kilos on it. Another said his dog could pull two hundred and fifty. A third 
    man, called Matthewson, said his dog could pull three hundred kilos.

    "That's nothing , " said Thornton. "Buck can pull three hundred and fifty." 

    "Can he break the sledge out when it's frozen to the ice and then start it 
    moving? And pull it a hundered metres?" asked Matthewson.

    "He can break it out, and start it, and pull it a hundred metres" said Thornton.

    "Well, " said Matthewson, speakig slowly and loudly. "I've got a thousand dollars 
    here, and I say he can't. " As he spoke, he took a bag of gold and put it 
    down on the table.

    Suddenly Thornton was worried. He knew Buck was strong, but was strong enough?
    Now ten men were watching him and waiting. He couldn't have a thousand dollars, 
    and neither did Hans and Pete.

    "I've got a sledge outsite with three hundrd and fifty kilos on it, " said 
    Matthewson. "So it's easy if you want to try." 

    Thornton didn't know what to say.(不知道说什么好). He looked at the other men 
    in the bar. One of them was an old friend, Jim O'Brien.

    "Can you lend me a thousand dollars, Jim?" he asked softly.

    "Sure, " said O'Brien, putting another bag of gold next to Matthewson's. "But 
    I dont thinnk the dog can do it, John." 

    Everybody went out into the street. There were two or three hundred men around 
    Matthewson's sledge. The sledge had been outside the bar for two hours, and 
    it was frozen on the ice, in a temperature of 50 below zero. Most of the men 
    thought that Buck was not strong enough, and Matthewson smiled heppily.

    "Shall we make it two thousand dollars?" he asked.

    Thornton, Hans and Pete talked for minute. They had only four hundred dollars,
    but they added this to O'Brien's thousand. Matthewson, very sure of winning.
    also put down another four hundred dollars.

    Matthewson's ten dogs were taken away, and Buck, who could feel the excitement 
    in the air, was harnessed to the sledge. Buck was, without question, a very 
    fine animal -- bright-eyed, intelligent, his thick coat shining with health.
    And he looked as strong as a horse.

    One man went up to Thornton. "I'll buy him now, " he said. "I'll give you 
    eight hundred dollars for him. "

    Thornton shook his head(摇头) and sat down the snow next to Buck. He held Buck's 
    head in his hands and spoke softly into his ear. "If you love me, Buck. If you 
    love me." 

    Buck took Thornton's hand between his teeth, then let go(松开), and Thornton 
    stood up and stepped back.

    "Ready, Buck, " he said.

    Buck pulled on the harness a little, getting ready.

    "Right!" cried Thornton.

    Buck pulled to the right, hard, stopped suddenly, and the ice under the slegde 
    began to break.

    "Now, left!" called Thornton, and Buck pulled to the left, breaking more of 
    the ice.

    "Now pull!" 

    Buck threw himself aganist his harness, and pulled. He held his body low to 
    the ground, his head down and forward, and his feet dug into the hard snow.
    Harder and harder he pulled. Suddenly, the sledge moved a centimetre..two..
    three...and, little by little, it started to go forward across the snow. With 
    each second it went a little faster, and Thornton ran behind, calling to Buck 
    as pulled the sledge towards the end of the hundred metres. The watching men 
    were shouting and throwing their hats in the air; Buck had won.

    Then Thornton was on the snow next to Buck again, talking to him, and Buck 
    had Thornton's hand in his teeth.
