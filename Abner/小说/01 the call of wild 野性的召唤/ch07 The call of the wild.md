    In five minutes Buck had made fourtenn hundred dollars for Thornton and his friends.
    The money made it possible for them to trval east, where they wanted to look for a 
    lost gold time. Men said that this mine had more gold than any other mine in the 
    northh. Many had looked for it, and some had died looking for it. The only men who 
    knew it was now dead.

    Thornton, Pete and Hans, with Buck and six other dogs, started off to the east 
    in the spring. They travlled up the Stewart River and crossed the Mackenize Mountais.
    They did not move quickly; the weather was good, and! the men shot animals for food 
    when they needed it. Sometimes they travlled for a week, and sometimes they stopped 
    for a week and searched for gold in the ground. Sometimes they were hungry, and 
    sometimes they had lots of food. They spent all the summer in the mountains, carrying 
    everything they needed on their barcks, sometimes making boats to go down rivers or 
    across lakes.

    In the autumn they came to a strange, flat country, with many lakes. They trvelled 
    on throuhg the winter and met nobody, but once they found an old wooden house, with 
    an old gun in it.

    When the spring came, they found, not the lost mine, but a lake in a wide valley. 
    Through the shallow water the gold showed like yellow butter, and here their search 
    ended. There was gold worth thousands of dollars in the lake, and they worked every
    day, filling bag after bag with gold.

    The dogs had nothing to do except wach the men and eat the food which the men shot 
    for them. Buck spent many evening sitting by the fire.

    At he sat, he saw again his dream world, where the strange hair man sat next to him. 
    He also heard something calling into the forest. Sometimes, in the middle of the day,
    he lifed his head and listend, and then ran off into the forest.

    One night he woke up and heard the call again, a long howl. He ran into the forest, folling 
    the sound, and came to an open place in the trees. And there, his nose pointing to 
    the sky, sat a wolf.

    The wolf stopped howling and Buck walked slowly towards him. The wolf ran and Buck 
    follwe. After a time, the wolf stopped and waited wathing Buck, ready to attack. But 
    Buck did not want to fiht, and soon the wolf relized this, and the two animals became 
    friedly. Then the wolf started to run again, and he dearly wanted Buck to follow 
    him. They ran for hours though the forest, and Buck rembermered again his dream 
    world where he, and others like him, had run throuh a much older forest.

    Then they stopped to drink, and Buck remembered John Thornton. He turned and started 
    to run back. The wolf folled him, then stopped and howled, but Buck ran on and did not 
    turn.

    Thornton was eating dinner when Buck returned. Buck jumped all over him, and for two 
    days never left his side. He followed him every where, watching him while he ate 
    and while he slept. But after tow days the call of the wilf came again, and  he 
    remembered the forest and the wolf who had run beside him.

    He started to sleep out in the forest at night, sometimgs staying out for three or 
    four days. Once he was away for a week, fishing and killing for food. He ate well, 
    and he grew stonger and quicker and more alive. Hie golden brown coat shone with 
    health as he ran through the forest, leaning its every secrt, every smell, and every 
    sound.

    "He's the finest dog that I've ever seen." said Thornton to his friends one day 
    as they watched Buck walking out of camp.

    "There'll never be another dog like him, " said Pete 

    They saw him walking out of camp but they didn't seen the change that happened 
    when he was inside in the forest. At once hecame a thing of the wild(野兽), stepping 
    softly and sliently, a passijng shaow among the trees.

    In the autumn, Buck started to see moose(驼鹿) in the forest. One day he met a group 
    of twenty. The larget was two metres tall, and his antlers(鹿角) were more than two 
    metres across. When he saw Buck, he got very angry. For hours Buck followed the 
    moose; he wanted the big one, but he wanted him alone. By the evening Buck had diven 
    the big old moose away form the other, and then he began his attack. The animal weighed 
    six hundred and fifty kilos-- he was big enough and strong engough to kill Buck in 
    seconds. Partiently, Buck followd him for four days, attacking and then jumped away.
    He gave him no peace, no time to eat or drink or rest, and slowly the moose became 
    weaker. At the end of fourtenn day Buck pulled the moose down and killed him. He 
    stayed by the dead animal for a day and a half, eating and then turned towards camp 
    and John Thornton.

    Five kilometres from the camp, he smelt something strang. Sometimmes was wrong. He 
    started to run. After a few hundred metres he found the dead body of Blackie, with 
    an arrow through his side. Then he found another sledeg-dog, dying, with an arrow in 
    his neck.

    Buck was near the camp now, and he could hear voice singing. Then he swa the body of 
    Hans, lying on his face, with ten or fifteen arrows in his back. Buck was suddenly
    filled with a wild, burning anger.

    The yeehats(印第安人) were dancing around the camp, when they heard a deep and terrible 
    growling. Buck came out of the trees faster than the north wind, and threw himself 
    on the Yeehats like a mad dog. He jumped at the first man, and tore his throat, killing 
    him at once. He jumped onto a second, then a third man, going each for the throat. The 
    Yeehats could neither escapde nor use their arrows. Buck moved like a storm among them,
    tearing, biting, destroying, in a madness that he had never know before. Nothing 
    could stop him, and soon he Yeehats were running, wild with fear, back to the forest.
    Buck followed for some tim then returned the camp.

    He found Pete, killed in his bed. He followed Thornton's smell to a deep pool, and 
    found Skeet lying dead by the edge. Thornton's body was somewhere under the water.

    All day Buk stayed by the pool or walked restleely round the camp. But when the evening 
    came, he heard new sounds from the forest; the wolves had come south for the winer, and 
    were moving into Buck's valley. They came into the camp in the moonlight, and Buck 
    stood silently, waiting for them. Suddenly, the bravest wolf jumped at Buck. In a
    second, Buck had bitten, and then stood still again. The wolf was dead behind him.
    Three more wolves jumped at him, and were killed.

    Then the pack attacked in a crowd all at once. But not one of them could bring Buck 
    down; he was too quick, too strong, too clear for them all. After half an hour the 
    pack stopped attacking and moved away. Then one of moved forward slowly, in a friendly 
    way; it was the wolf that Buck had met before in the forest. They touched nose. Then 
    another came forward to make friends, and another. Soon the pack was around Buck, and 
    the call of the will was loud in Buck's ears. And when the wolves no,  back into 
    the forest, Buck ran with them, side by side.

    That is parhaps the end jof Buck's story. But after a few years, the Yeehats noticed 
    that some of the wolves had golden borwn in their grey coat. They also talked of a 
    Ghost God that ran at the head of the pack.

    And sometimes men were found dead, killed by the teeth of a terrible animal. And 
    each autumn, when the Yeehats follow the moose, there is no valley that they will 
    not go into.

    In the summers there is one vistor to that valley; a large, golden-brown wolf, 
    large than any other wolf. He walks alone round the lake where the yellow gold 
    shine in the water, and howls. But hs is not always alone. In the long winter 
    nights, he runs at head of the wolf pack through the moonlight, calling into 
    the night with them, siging a song from a younger world.
