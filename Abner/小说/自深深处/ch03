    I will begin by telling you that I blame myself terribly.

    As I sit here in this dark cell in convict(有罪) clothes, a disgraced and ruined man, I blame myself.

    From the very first there was too wide a gap between us.

    You had been idel at your school, worse than idle at your university.

    You admired my work when it was finished: you enjoyed the brilliant successes of my first nights,,, and the brilliant banquets(宴会) that 
    followed them: you were proud, and quite naturally so, of being the intimate friend of an artist so distinguished: but you could not understand
    the conditions requisites for the productijon of artistic work.

    I am not speaking in phrases of rhetorical exaggeration(夸大) but in terms of absolute truth to actual fact when I remind you that during
    the whole time we were together I never wrote one single line.

    Whether at Torguay, Goring, London, Florence or elsewhere, my life, as long as you were by my side, was entirely sterile(贫瘠的) and uncreative.
    And with but few intervals your were , I regret to say, by my side always.(你总在我的身边)
