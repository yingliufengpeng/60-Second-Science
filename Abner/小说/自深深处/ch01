    Dear Bosie, After long and fruitless(无果的) waiting I have determinied to write to you mysellf,
    as much for your sake for mine, as I would not like to think that I had passed through two long 
    years of imprisonment without ever having received a single line from you.

    The world will konw nothing of whatever words of grief or passion, of remorse(悔恨) or indifference 
    you may choose to send as your answer or your appeal.

    I have no doubt that in this letter there will be much that will wound your vanity to the quick.

    If it prove so, read the letter over and over again till it kills your vanity.

    If there be in it one single passage that brings tears to your eyes, weep as we weep in prison
    where the day no less the night(黑夜与白日无异) is set spart for tears.

    It is the only thing that can save you.
