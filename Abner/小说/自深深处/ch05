    I remember one morning sitting in the yellowing woods at Brachnell with your monther.

    At that time K knew very little of your real nature.

    She told me of you two chief faults, your vanity and your being, as she termed it, "all wrong about money."

    I have a distinct recollection(回忆) of how I laughed.

    I thought vanity a sort of graceful flower for a young man to war, as for extravagance -- the virtues of prudence(谨慎,节俭) and thrift(节约)
    were not in my own nature.

    I had no idea that the first would bring me to prison, and the second to bankruptcy.
