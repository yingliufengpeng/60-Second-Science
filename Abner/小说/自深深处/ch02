    If you go complaining to your mother, as you did with reference to the scorn(蔑视) of you I 
    displayed(流露) in my letter to RObbie, so that she may flatter(奉承) and soothe you back into 
    self-complacency(自满) or conceit(自负), you will be completely lost(没救了).

    Do you still say, as you said to Robbie in your answer, that I " attribute unworthy motives" to
    you? (卑劣动机于你).

    You had no motives in life. You had apppetites(欲望) merely.

    That you were "very young" when our friendship began? Your defect was not that you knew so litle 
    about lfe, but that you knew so much.

    The morning dawn of boyhood(孩童时代) with its delicate(微妙的) bloom, its joy of innocence and 
    expectation you had left far behind.

    You had passed from Romance to Relalism. The gutter and the things hat live in it had begun 
    to fascinate you.

    Remember that the fool in the eyes of the gods and the fool in the eyes of man are very different.

    The real fool, such as gods mock or mar(蔑视), is he who does not know himself.

    I was such a one too long.

    You have been such a one too long.

    Be so no more.

    Do not be afraid.

    The supreme vice(恶习) is shallowness(肤浅).

    Everything that is realised(意识到) is right.
