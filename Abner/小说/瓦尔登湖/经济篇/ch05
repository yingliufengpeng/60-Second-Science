    Some of you, we all know, are poor.

    I have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and 
    shoes which are fst wearing or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your crditors(债权人)
    of an hour.

    It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, always on the limits, trying to get into business and trying to get out 
    of debt, always promising to pay promisiong to pay, tomorrow, and dying today, insolvent(无力偿还); lying, flattering, contracting yourselves 
    into a nutshell of civility(礼貌,谦恭) or dilating(膨胀) into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your neighbor 
    to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his cat, or his carriage, or import his groceries(食品杂货) for him; making yourselves sick, that 
    you may lay up(存钱) something against a sick day. (你们把自己累得病倒，为的是能够存下点防病的钱。)
