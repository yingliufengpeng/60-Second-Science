    When I wrote the follwing pages or rahter the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile
    form any neighbor,in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, 
    Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only.

    I lived there two years and two months.

    At present I am a sojourner(寄客) in civilized life again.

    I should not obtrude(强行) my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular 
    inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call 
    impertinent(莽撞的), though they do not appear to me(固定搭配/对我来说) at all impertinent, but,
    considering the circumstances, very naatural and pertinent(切题的).

    Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like(等等).

    Ohters have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable(慈善的) 
    purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained.

    I will there fore ask those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me 
    if I undertake to answer some of these questions in this book.

    In most books, the I, or first person, is omitted; in this it will be retained.

    We commonly(通常) do not remember that it is, after all, always the first person is speaking.

    I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.
