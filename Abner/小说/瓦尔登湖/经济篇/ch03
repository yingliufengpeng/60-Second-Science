    I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited  farms, houses, barns(谷仓), and farming tools; for there are more 
    easily acquired than got rid of.

    Better if they had been born in the open pasture(牧场) and suckled(吃奶) by a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes that field
    they were called to labor in.

    Why should they eat their 60 acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of diry?

    Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born?

    Howmn many a poor immortal(平凡的) soul have I met, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it  a barn 75 feet by 40, and 1000 acres 
    of land, tillage(耕地), mowing(牧草地)，pasture(放牧场), and woodlot(林地)!

    The portionless(没有财产的人), how struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor enought to subdue and cultivate
    a few cubic feet of flesh(血肉之躯).
