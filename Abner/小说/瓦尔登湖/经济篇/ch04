    But men labor under a mistake.

    The better part of the man is soon plowed into(犁入) the soil for compost(肥料).

    By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity(需求), they are employed, as it says in an ol book, laying up treasures which moth(蛾子) and 
    rust(锈蚀) will corrupt and thieves break through and steal.

    It is a fool's life as they willl find when they get to the end of it, if not beofre.

    Most men, even in this comparatively free country, are so occupied with the factitious(虚伪的) cares and labors of life that its finer cannot 
    be plucked(摘取) by them.

    Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy(笨拙的) and tremble too much for that.

    Actually, the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest(高尚的) relations to men;
    his labor would be deprciated(贬值) in the market.

    He has no time to be anything but a machine.

    How can he remember well his ignorance, which his growth requries, who has so often to use his knowledge?

    we should feed and clothe him gratuitously(慷慨地) sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials(不含酒精的饮料), before we judge of him.

    The finest qualities of our nature(本性), like the bloom(粉霜) on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling.

    Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly. (我们在对待自己和彼此相处时，却缺少这样的轻柔)
