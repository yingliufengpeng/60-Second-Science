    Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience.

    Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere
    account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; such 
    account(一种描述) as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived 
    sincerely; it must have been in a distant land to me.

    Perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students.

    As for the rest of my readers, they will accept such portions(部分) as apply to them.

    I trust that none will stretch the seams(接口/接缝) in putting on the coat, for it my do good 
    service to him whom it fits.

    I have traveled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields,
    the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance(苦修/赎罪) in 1,1000 remarkable(非凡的) ways.
