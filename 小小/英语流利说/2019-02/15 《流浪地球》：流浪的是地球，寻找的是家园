China’s film industry finally joins the space race
China was a latecomer to space exploration, and in the movies, it has been a latecomer to science 
fiction, too. That is about to change.

The country’s first blockbuster(大片) set in space, “The Wandering Earth,” opens Tuesday amid 
grandiose(宏大的) expectations that it will represent the dawning of a new era in Chinese filmmaking.

“The Wandering Earth,” shown in 3D, takes place in a distant future in which the sun is about to 
expand into a red giant and devour the Earth. And the preliminary reviews have been positive.

“Filmmakers in China see science fiction as a holy grail(圣杯),” said Raymond Zhou, an independent 
critic, who noted that Hollywood had set the technological standards, and thus audience expectations, 
very high.

“The Wandering Earth” is adapted from works by Liu Cixin, the writer who has led a renaissance in 
science fiction here, becoming the first Chinese winner of the Hugo Award for the genre(类型) in 2015.
His novels are sprawling(意外的) epics(壮举) and deeply researched. That makes them plausible(貌似真实的) 
fantasies about humanity’s encounters with a dangerous universe.

The openings also come as China reached a milestone in space: the landing of a probe on the far side of 
the moon in January. Although decades behind Russia and the United States, China has now put astronauts 
in orbit and has ambitious plans to join-or even lead a new age of space exploration.

“I think there is a very close connection between Chinese cinema(电影) and the nation’s fortunes,” said
Sha Dan, a curator(总监) at the China Film Archive.
