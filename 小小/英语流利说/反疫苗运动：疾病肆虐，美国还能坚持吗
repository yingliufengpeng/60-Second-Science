    An anti-vaccination(疫苗) ‘hotspot’(运动) near Portland declares an emergency over measles(某种病毒)
    outbreak(爆发)

    A quickly escalating(逐步增大的) measles outbreak around Portland, Oregon, has led health officials 
    in nearly Clark Country, Washington, to declare a public health emergency.

    At the beginning of last week, there were only a handful of confirmed cases. On Friday, the day 
    the emergency was declared, there were 19. The latest update came Tuesday, when country officials 
    said they had confirmed 23 cases and were investigating two more suspected cases. The vast 
    majority of those who have fallen ill had not been immunized(免疫).

    The outbreak makes concrete the fears of pediatric(小儿科的) epidemiologists(流行病专家) that a 
    citadel of (a lot of) the movement against compulsory(强制的) vaccination could be 
    susceptible(易受感染的) to the rapid spread of a potentially deadly disease(绝症).

    State data shows that 7.9 percent of children in Clark Country were exempted(豁免) in the 2017-18 
    school year from vaccines required for kindergarten(幼儿园) entry, which includes the two-dose 
    course for measles that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is 97 percent 
    effective. Nationally, about 2 percent of children went without required immunization for 
    nonmedical(非医学的) reasons.

    Because measles is among the most highly contagious of all infectious diseases, it is bound to 
    spring up(迅速起来) in areas with low vaccination rates, according to Peter J. Hotez, a professor of 
    pediatrics(免疫) and dean(教务长) of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of 
    Medicine in Houston.

    This is something I’ve predicted for a while now, “he said of the public health emergency in Clark 
    Country. “It’s really awful and really tragic and totally preventable(可预防的).”
