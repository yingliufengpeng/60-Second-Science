    Cause I'm under trial, I don't feel my freedom, still. Cause I have a thing, you know, hanging 
there, and it's not over.

    So I hope that this will finish, I'm not optimistic. Tell me about what happened and what you did.

    The boat started taking water and the engine truned off. The boat was overcrowded(超载), and just a 
dinghy(救生艇).

    I'm a long-distance swimmer and i knew I can survive. I stand up and I jump into the water.

    And then my sister joined, and just we used all the swimming resources that we have. It was a very
rough sea that day.

    How long did it take? It's three and a half hours to make it to the sheoreline of Lesbos(莱斯沃斯).
All the people on the boat, we believed we are going to make it and we wanted to make it, that's why I
thinnk we made it.

    Cause we all worked together and we believed. I made it to Europe, but I didn't know that it was just 
the beginning. I'm very proud of my sister beacuase she has a very young age when she went through all this.

    She handled it very well. So I was very impressed that she could do that.
