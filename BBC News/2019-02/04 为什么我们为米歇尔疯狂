    Let me tell you something, I say all of this tonight, not just as First Lady, no, not just as a wife.
You see, at the end of the daly my most importantt title is still Mom-in-Chief(首席妈妈).

    If you talk to her biggest tans, they'll tell you that she makes women feel inspired, empowered and 
capable of anything. Be focused. Be determined. Be hopefull. Be empowered.

    We forget, convenientlly though, that she is an unelected figurehead, that she only has the platform that 
she has, becauseof the man she married. In hte converage surrouding her book, the biggest hadlines were not 
releated of girl's education, or her achieveemnts in raising awareness of obesity.

    Instead, they were focused on her struggles with infertility(不孕) and miscarriage(流产) and on her honest about the ups
and downs of married life. Does this really represent feminist empowered?

    I come here as a wife, who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president. She somehow 
managed to transcend her role as Barack Obama's wife, to become a leadership role model in her own right.

    I see a roomful of business leaders, and surgeons and barristers(大律师). I see women who are going to win elections.

    But part of her appeal must lie in the fact she doesn't hold elected office. And so she's able to speak more freely and
express her frustraion(挫折,沮丧) more ealily.

    Despite the emergence of hashtags #Michell2002 or #Michelle2024, Michelle Obama has said repeatedly that political power
holds no appeal for her and she will never stand for public office(担任公职).

    She said this almost as many times as the last person who said they would absolutely never ever stand for persident. That 
was Donald Trump. Thank you all and God bless.
